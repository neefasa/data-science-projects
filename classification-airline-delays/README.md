# Classification Airline Delays

Problem: Is there an underlying pattern to airline departure delays?

Design: I used the data availible at the [Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.bts.gov/) website as well as the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev). From there I made a classification model to predict which flights would be delayed more than 5 minutes.

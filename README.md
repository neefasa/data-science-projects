# My First Data Science Projects
This winter I undertook a data science bootcamp with [Metis](https://www.thisismetis.com/data-science-bootcamps), a full-time, accredited, immersive bootcamp.  The pedagogy of the bootcamp focused on developing experience through tackling projects with real world data. The following are my five projects.

## [Project focused on EDA](https://github.com/neefasa/data-science-projects/tree/master/eda-nyc-subway-usage)

Some exploritory data analysis on NYC transit data

Pandas | Matplotlib | Jupyter Notebook



## [Project focused on regression](https://github.com/neefasa/data-science-projects/tree/master/regression-sports-attendance)

Predicted average attendance for teams of major league sports in North America

BeautifulSoup | GeoPy | Linear Regression | Regularization |SciKit-Learn



## [Project focused on classification](https://github.com/neefasa/ohare-flight-delays)

Predicted whether a flight departing O'Hare International airport would be delayed

Random Forest | PostgreSQL | AWS 



## [Project focused on NLP](https://github.com/neefasa/data-science-projects/tree/master/nlp-99pi-rec)

Topic modeled transcripts for a podcast called "99 Percent Invisible" and developed a recommender

Non-negative Matrix Factoriztion | Tableau | Flask |MongoDB



## [Project focused on NLP and unsupervised learning](https://github.com/neefasa/data-science-projects/tree/master/nlp-clustering-netflix)

Topic modeled and clustered Netflix shows using show description and developed a recommender

Latent Dirichlet Allocation | K-means clustering | Plot.ly

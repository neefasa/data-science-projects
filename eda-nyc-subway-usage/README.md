# Exploritory Data Analysis of NYC Subway Usage

Problem: The premise of this project was to help a fictitious non-profit optimize it's placement of canvasing teams around subway stations in Manhattan. The non-profit was planning to have a fundraising gala and wanted to increase it's exposure by getting emails of those interesting in it's mission.   

Design: NYC subway data is made public through the MTA website. The data is organized as ticker readings of individual turnstiles. Using Pandas, I was able to find the busiest stations.

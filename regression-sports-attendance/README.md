# Predicting Sports Attendance

Problem: Chicago's MLS team, the Chicago Fire, are moving from the suburbs back to Soldier Field in the heart of Chicago. I wanted to investigate what kind of effect the move would have on their attendance.

Design: I scraped the data about the major league sports in North America and made a linear regression model to predict average attendance for a team.
